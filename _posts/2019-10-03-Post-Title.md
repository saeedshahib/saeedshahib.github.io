÷ I talked to 6 TA's about schedueling lessons
- There are some points i've got from their words:
they told me how to study university lessons that are so much diffrent with high school
and the main point was we have to appropriate most of our time studying lessons
on the other hand we need to have fun beside study and we should'nt forget having fun
